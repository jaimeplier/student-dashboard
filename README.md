# student-dashboard
A student dashboard built with React, Mobx and Parcel as bundler

# Launch
To run localy start the project with "npm run dev" after installing dependancies.

## Note:
- Uses Mobx store to view single student profile, a better implementation would be to use route parameter but for demostration purpose this works.
- Added live server to run the build
